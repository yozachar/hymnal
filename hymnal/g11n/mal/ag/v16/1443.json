Sweet hour of prayer!","That calls me from a world of care","And bids me at my Father's throne","Make all my wants and wishes known","In seasons of distress and grief","My soul has often found relief","And oft escaped the tempter's snare","By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!"]},{"number":2,"lines":["Sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer!","May I thy consolation share?","Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height","I view my home and take my flight","This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise","To seize the everlasting prize","And shout, while passing through the air","Farewell, farewell, Sweet hour of prayer!"]}]}
